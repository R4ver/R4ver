### About
To descripe me shortly, as mentioned above "I do stuff". I do a bunch of different things that peak my interest, mainly on the design aspect, but being able to go from design to product was probably what sparked the fire in me to learn how to code and bring my ideas to life.<br />


### Accomplishments
<b>ROSC (VRChat OSC Program)</b>
Mainly a module launchers for different OSC programs with easy UI making in the form of MDX files and custom components.
Utilizing WebSockets to communicate between UI and modules.

<b>Twixera (Mixera)</b><br/>
I think the project I'm most proud of is my [browser](https://github.com/R4ver/twixera) extension which first was made for Mixer.com (bless its soul) and now Twitch.

<b>Currently Live (plugin for Elgato Streamdeck)</b><br/>
When Mixer was still a thing, I dipped my toes in creating plugins for the Streamdeck. I created a plugin that would display if a user was live or not on Mixer by altering their profile image to be grayscaled (offline) and in color (online) + by clicking on the button on the Streamdeck it would take them to their channel in their prefered browser.

<b>Fan Progression Alert</b><br/>
This was a small overlay streamers on Mixer could use to display an alert on stream whenever one of their viewers gained a new level/rank in the channel.
